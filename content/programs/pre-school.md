At Primoris, we understand that early childhood education is fundamental to your child's growth and development. Consistent with our philosophy for the rest of our school, our pre-school is designed to encourage curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving. Our program provides children the skills and structure they need to succeed in their elementary school years and beyond.
