In elementary and middle school, we set the stage for well-rounded development and a lifelong love of learning. Curriculum-wise, a strong core of humanities and STEM subjects is complemented by foreign language, arts, and numerous other enrichment classes. Unlike most other elementary schools, Primoris does not use a single-teacher approach to instructing across multiple subjects. Each subject is taught by a different teacher, i.e. a subject matter expert! Additionally, we emphasize mastery over test scores.

Beyond academics, students develop routines, habits, and characteristics that reinforce a positive learning environment, such as personal responsibility, teamwork, and perseverance.
